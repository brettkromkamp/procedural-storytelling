Procedural Storytelling-related Algorithms, Data-sets and Resources by Brett Kromkamp
=====================================================================================

As the title implies, this repo is (will be) a collection of scripts, data-sets and algorithms that are especially relevant for procedural storytelling. Areas to explore include world-building, semantic modeling for narratives in general and procedural generation of plots and characters in particular.
